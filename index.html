				<p>A & GPUs
					A recurring theme throughout many of the guest lectures in my BADM 261 class was the advent of AI and its wave of transformation in the functioning of current business processes and its implications for the future. This topic is highly relevant in many discussions and has piqued the interest of my engineering side. It prompted me to dive deeper into what will make strong AI possible. What technologies and engineering principles will drive the future of this disruptive technology? The future of this technology can be summed up in three letters: GPU.
The Graphical Processing Unit is a critical component of modern computing, making many of today’s most complex processes possible. It works in tandem with the CPU (Central Processing Unit), but what sets it apart is its unparalleled efficiency in parallel processing. Unlike CPUs, which excel at sequential tasks, GPUs shine when it comes to handling multiple tasks simultaneously. This unique selling point enables them to execute massive amounts of computations at significantly faster speeds than CPUs. Originally, GPUs were invented to improve graphics processing for video games and 3D modeling software. Their ability to handle heavy computational loads efficiently eventually caught the attention of industries far beyond gaming.

The blockchain industry, for instance, relies heavily on computational power. In blockchain networks, GPUs play a vital role in the verification process. They ensure that transactions are securely validated at incredible speeds, forming the backbone of many blockchain-based technologies. Similarly, the rise of AI capabilities owes much to GPUs. These chips have become prized assets, with companies competing to acquire them to fuel their AI ambitions. As the number of GPUs in use increases, so does the breadth of computation available, enabling AI models to incorporate more data and context. This allows for deeper, more sophisticated training and ensures that AI systems can perform previously impossible tasks.

One of the most exciting advancements in the world of GPUs is NVIDIA’s Blackwell architecture. This next-generation GPU is set to replace the current industry standards and represents a significant leap forward in computing power. Blackwell is expected to deliver greater efficiency with a focus on tailoring itself for AI workloads. NVIDIA has already positioned itself as the leader in AI hardware, and the Blackwell chip cements this position further. With improved energy efficiency and the ability to handle even larger datasets, Blackwell GPUs will make it easier to train expansive AI models while lowering operational costs.
The implications of Blackwell for AI development are enormous. For example, the chip’s enhanced performance will allow AI researchers and engineers to experiment with more complex neural networks, significantly improving capabilities in fields like natural language processing, image recognition, and autonomous systems. Blackwell is also designed to address one of the most pressing challenges in AI: energy consumption. While AI capabilities grow, so does their demand for computational resources, leading companies to invest heavily in energy infrastructure.
To prepare for this upcoming race in GPU acquisition and deployment, tech giants like Meta, Google, and NVIDIA are securing long-term contracts with energy suppliers. They recognise that as AI scales, so will the energy requirements to power these GPU-driven computing stations. NVIDIA, for example, has been instrumental in ensuring that its GPUs are optimised for AI workloads, emphasising not only performance but also sustainability. The Blackwell chip exemplifies this focus, combining raw processing power with features designed to minimise energy use.
In fact, there is a company that is trying to develop a derivatives market for GPUs. This is  monumental step for technology. A technological component is set to be used as an underlying asset for a financial market. This speaks volumes about the future that GPU and AI have. The reason that it is such a good ideas is because of the secondary/spot market that is already in development where people are pricing GPUs according to demand. With the anticipated hedging and acquisition of such GPUs for future demands, this seems like a solid idea.
Looking ahead, the role of GPUs in shaping our technological future cannot be overstated. As companies continue to invest in these transformative technologies, the importance of GPUs will only grow.
GPUs are more than just a component of modern computers, they are the engines driving today’s technological revolutions.
